    # This flag is used to mark that a migration shouldn't be automatically run in production. For
    # the most part, this should only be used for operations where it's safe to run the migration
    # after your code has deployed. So this should not be used for most operations that alter the
    # schema of a table.
    # Here are some things that make sense to mark as dangerous:
    # - Large data migrations. Typically we want these to be run manually by ops so that they can
    #   be monitored and not block the deploy for a long period of time while they run.
    # - Adding indexes to large tables. Since this can take a long time, we'd generally prefer to
    #   have ops run this and not block the deploy. Note that while adding an index is a schema
    #   change, it's completely safe to run the operation after the code has deployed.
